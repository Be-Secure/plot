// just thinking about how (cartesian) positional scales have axes, but radial
// scales don't. why not? well, they could â€” but only for a single fixed center!
// in practice, radial scales are almost always used to scale circles with
// different centers, so each would need its own axis. so it's like faceting!!
// an un-faceted radial visualization would have a shared center; if there are
// circles with dif centers, it's faceted by x and y.
